This is a Google Docs Clone, that I have made with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com)

## Getting Started

Demo can be found [here](https://google-docs-bfazyogxe-akaahl.vercel.app/)

Authentication is provided by Google and Firebase, which means that you can sign up with you Gmail account.

## How to use

To start with, after signing up with your Gmail account, you can start creating a new blank document.

You may click on the document's file, and start editing the draft. As simple as that.
